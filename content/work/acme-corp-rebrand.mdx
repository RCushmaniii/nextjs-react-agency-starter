# Acme Corp Rebrand

Acme Corp approached us with a challenge: their existing website didn't reflect the quality of their product. As a fast-growing B2B SaaS company, they needed a digital presence that would attract enterprise customers and showcase their technical sophistication.

## The Challenge

The existing site had several problems:

- **Outdated Design** - Built 5 years ago and showing its age
- **Poor Performance** - Slow load times hurting SEO and conversions
- **Not Mobile-Friendly** - Over 40% of traffic on mobile, but the experience was poor
- **Hard to Update** - Marketing team couldn't make changes without developer help

## Our Approach

We proposed a complete rebuild using modern technologies:

### Technical Stack

- **Next.js 14** for optimal performance and SEO
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, consistent styling
- **Vercel** for zero-downtime deployments

### Design Philosophy

We focused on three key principles:

1. **Clarity** - Clear messaging that speaks to enterprise buyers
2. **Performance** - Lightning-fast load times on all devices
3. **Flexibility** - Easy for the marketing team to update content

## The Solution

### Homepage Redesign

We created a new homepage that immediately communicates Acme's value proposition. Key features include:

- **Hero Section** with clear messaging and strong CTA
- **Social Proof** featuring logos of major customers
- **Feature Highlights** with benefits-focused copy
- **Testimonials** from enterprise clients
- **Bottom-Line CTA** driving free trial signups

### Product Pages

Each product got its own page with:

- Technical specifications
- Use case examples
- Integration capabilities
- Pricing tiers
- Customer success stories

### Resource Hub

We built a resource center featuring:

- Blog articles
- Case studies
- Whitepapers
- Video tutorials
- Documentation

All content is managed through MDX, making it easy for the team to publish new resources.

## Results

The new site launched in 6 weeks and delivered immediate results:

### Performance Metrics

- **Lighthouse Score**: 98 (up from 52)
- **Page Load Time**: 1.2s (down from 4.8s)
- **Core Web Vitals**: All green (previously all red)

### Business Impact

- **Conversion Rate**: +42% increase in free trial signups
- **Time on Site**: +65% improvement in engagement
- **Bounce Rate**: -38% reduction
- **SEO Rankings**: +24 positions on average for target keywords

### Team Efficiency

- Marketing team can now update content without developer help
- Deployments happen automatically on content changes
- No more waiting for development cycles to publish articles

## Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations

We implemented several techniques to ensure blazing-fast performance:

```typescript
// Example: Optimized image loading
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Acme Corp Platform"
  width={1200}
  height={600}
  priority
/>
```

- Automatic image optimization
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Edge caching for global users
- Preloading critical resources

### SEO Best Practices

Every page includes:

- Optimized metadata
- Structured data for rich results
- Semantic HTML
- Fast loading speeds
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Client Feedback

> "The new website has transformed how prospects perceive our company. We're finally competing on equal footing with the big players in our space. The team at Agency delivered beyond our expectations." - Sarah Johnson, CEO, Acme Corp

## Key Takeaways

This project demonstrates several important principles:

1. **Modern tools enable speed** - Using Next.js, we delivered in 6 weeks what would have taken 4 months with older tech
2. **Performance matters** - Better Core Web Vitals directly improved SEO and conversions
3. **Empower the team** - Content management doesn't require developers anymore
4. **Measure everything** - Data-driven decisions led to the 42% conversion lift

## Next Steps

We continue to support Acme Corp with:

- Monthly performance audits
- A/B testing new features
- Ongoing content optimization
- Feature enhancements based on user feedback
