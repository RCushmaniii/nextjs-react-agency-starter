# Bloom E-commerce Platform

Bloom is a direct-to-consumer sustainable fashion brand with a mission to make eco-friendly clothing accessible and desirable. They needed an e-commerce platform that would match the quality of their products with an exceptional online shopping experience.

## The Challenge

Bloom was launching as a new brand and needed:

- **Fast Time to Market** - Launch before the holiday season (3 months away)
- **Beautiful Design** - Reflect their premium, eco-conscious brand
- **Smooth Checkout** - Zero friction in the purchase process
- **Mobile-First** - 70% of sustainable fashion shoppers browse on mobile
- **Performance** - Fast load times essential for conversion rates

## Our Solution

We built a custom Next.js e-commerce platform tailored to Bloom's unique needs.

### Key Features

#### Product Catalog

- High-quality product photography with zoom
- Size guides and fit recommendations
- Sustainability metrics for each item
- Color and size selection
- Stock availability indicators

#### Shopping Experience

- Persistent shopping cart across sessions
- Wishlist functionality
- Quick view modals
- Product recommendations
- Recently viewed items

#### Checkout Flow

We optimized the checkout process to minimize abandonment:

1. **Cart Review** - Clear breakdown of items and pricing
2. **Customer Info** - Simple form with validation
3. **Shipping Options** - Multiple carriers with estimated delivery
4. **Payment** - Secure Stripe integration
5. **Confirmation** - Order summary and tracking info

The entire flow is mobile-optimized and works without page reloads.

### Technical Implementation

#### Performance

We achieved exceptional performance through:

- **Image Optimization** - Next.js automatic image optimization
- **Code Splitting** - Load only what's needed for each page
- **Edge Caching** - Product data cached at the edge
- **Lazy Loading** - Images load as users scroll

Result: 1.8s average page load time and 96 Lighthouse score.

#### Stripe Integration

We integrated Stripe for payments:

```typescript
// Example: Server-side payment intent creation
import Stripe from 'stripe'

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)

async function createPaymentIntent(amount: number) {
  return await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
    currency: 'usd',
    automatic_payment_methods: { enabled: true },
  })
}
```

Features include:

- Credit card processing
- Apple Pay and Google Pay
- Secure checkout
- Subscription support
- Automatic receipts

#### Mobile Experience

With 70% mobile traffic, we prioritized mobile:

- Touch-friendly UI elements
- Swipeable product images
- Mobile-optimized forms
- One-tap payment methods
- Progressive Web App capabilities
