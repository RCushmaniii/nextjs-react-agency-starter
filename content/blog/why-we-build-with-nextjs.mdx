# Why We Build with Next.js

When it comes to building modern web applications, the choice of framework can make or break a project. After years of experience with various technologies, we've settled on Next.js as our go-to framework. Here's why.

## Performance Out of the Box

Next.js provides exceptional performance optimizations without requiring extensive configuration. Features like automatic code splitting, image optimization, and built-in caching mean our applications load faster and provide better user experiences from day one.

The framework's hybrid rendering capabilities allow us to choose the best rendering strategy for each page:

- **Static Generation** for marketing pages and blog posts
- **Server-Side Rendering** for dynamic, personalized content
- **Client-Side Rendering** for highly interactive components

## Developer Experience

The developer experience with Next.js is unmatched. File-based routing, fast refresh, and TypeScript support out of the box mean our team can move quickly without sacrificing code quality.

```typescript
// Example: Creating a new page is as simple as adding a file
export default function AboutPage() {
  return <h1>About Us</h1>
}
```

## Production Ready

Next.js is battle-tested at scale by companies like Netflix, TikTok, and Twitch. The framework handles edge cases, provides robust error handling, and makes it easy to implement best practices.

Deployment is seamless with Vercel, but the framework is flexible enough to deploy anywhere - from traditional hosting to serverless environments.

## The Ecosystem

The React ecosystem is vast, and Next.js sits at the center of it. We can leverage the entire npm ecosystem while benefiting from Next.js's opinionated approach to common challenges like:

- Routing and navigation
- API routes and backend logic
- SEO and metadata management
- Image and font optimization

## Future-Proof

The Next.js team at Vercel is constantly innovating. Features like the App Router, Server Components, and streaming SSR keep the framework at the cutting edge of web development.

By building with Next.js, we ensure our clients' applications are built on a foundation that will continue to evolve and improve.

## Conclusion

Next.js gives us the perfect balance of performance, developer experience, and flexibility. It allows us to build production-grade applications quickly while maintaining high standards for code quality and user experience.

If you're considering Next.js for your next project, we highly recommend it. And if you need help getting started, [get in touch](/contact) - we'd love to help.
