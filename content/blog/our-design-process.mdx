# Our Design Process

Great design doesn't happen by accident. It's the result of a thoughtful, iterative process that puts users first while solving real business problems. Here's how we approach design at Agency.

## 1. Discovery & Research

Every project starts with understanding. We dig deep to learn about:

- **Business Goals** - What are you trying to achieve?
- **User Needs** - Who are your users and what do they need?
- **Competitive Landscape** - What are others doing well (or poorly)?
- **Technical Constraints** - What's possible within your timeline and budget?

We conduct stakeholder interviews, user research, and competitive analysis to ensure we're building on a solid foundation of understanding.

## 2. Define & Strategize

Armed with research, we define the problem we're solving and create a strategy to address it. This phase includes:

- Creating user personas
- Mapping user journeys
- Defining key features and functionality
- Prioritizing what to build first

The goal is to align everyone on what we're building and why.

## 3. Ideate & Sketch

This is where creativity happens. We explore multiple solutions through:

- **Rapid sketching** - Low-fidelity ideas on paper or whiteboard
- **Wireframing** - Structured layouts showing information hierarchy
- **User flows** - How users will move through the experience

We don't get attached to any single idea. Instead, we explore widely before narrowing down.

## 4. Design & Prototype

Once we've validated the direction, we move into high-fidelity design:

- **Visual Design** - Typography, color, imagery, and brand expression
- **Component Systems** - Reusable UI patterns for consistency
- **Interactive Prototypes** - Clickable demos that feel real

We work in close collaboration with stakeholders, gathering feedback and iterating quickly.

## 5. Test & Validate

Before development begins, we validate our designs with real users:

- **Usability Testing** - Can users complete key tasks?
- **Accessibility Review** - Does it work for everyone?
- **Technical Review** - Is it feasible to build?

This step often reveals insights that lead to refinements before code is written.

## 6. Handoff & Collaborate

Design doesn't end when development begins. We:

- Create detailed design specifications
- Provide developer support during implementation
- Review builds to ensure design fidelity
- Make adjustments based on technical constraints

The best work happens when designers and developers collaborate closely.

## 7. Launch & Learn

After launch, we measure success and learn:

- Monitor analytics and user behavior
- Gather user feedback
- Identify opportunities for improvement
- Plan future enhancements

Great design is never "done" - it evolves based on real-world data and user needs.

## Key Principles

Throughout this process, we hold firm to core principles:

- **User-Centered** - Every decision considers the user's perspective
- **Collaborative** - We work closely with stakeholders and developers
- **Iterative** - We refine and improve based on feedback
- **Accessible** - We design for everyone, not just the average user
- **Intentional** - Every design choice has a purpose

## Conclusion

This process isn't rigid - we adapt it to each project's unique needs. But the core philosophy remains: understand deeply, explore widely, validate early, and iterate continuously.

The result? Designs that look beautiful, work flawlessly, and solve real problems for real people.
